						<td>Traffickers have been known to force their victims to undergo voodoo rituals, a means used to establish their hold on them and ensure they never run away or divulge the traffickers’ secret.
						From Nigeria the victims “were then moved by boat to Libya and Italy, before arriving in Spain,” the NCA said in a statement on its website.
						“The women were forced to live in cave-like houses in unsafe and unsanitary conditions, unable to leave and sexually exploited for the sole purpose of financial gain for the gang leaders, with all money eventually ending up in their hands in Nigeria.”
						The statement said a total of 89 people, including the leader of the gang, were arrested in the course of the investigation, with 43 of them remanded in prison.
